# bowling-score-calculator

I completed this assessment in javascript

I created a frontend for the function using twitter bootstrap: https://ianwalston.github.io/bowling-score-calculator/. 

The function that converts the input string to a total score can be found in calc.js: https://github.com/IanWalston/bowling-score-calculator/blob/master/calc.js#L4-L84

The function contains ES6 syntax and will only work in modern browsers

Input is not validated
